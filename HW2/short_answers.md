Question definition: The step where you work to clearly define the problem/question you are trying to answer with the given data.\
Data collection: When you gather/clean the relevant data for the future steps.\
Data Annotation: This is where you apply features to the data to be used in the next step\
Data Analysis: This is were you create you model to help have \'93clean\'94 quantative data\
Interpretation: Where you take the models created and interpret the data that you now have to help answer the question asked\
Communication: Where you communicate how your data answers the question to your high ups.\

A loop can occur when you find that the data you collected doesn\'92t give you enough or the right information to help answer the question asked}
